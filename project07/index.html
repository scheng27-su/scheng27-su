            <p>According to Amazon Web Services, the Internet of Things (IoTs) is the collective network of connected devices and the technology that facilitates communication between devices and the cloud and between the devices themselves. This website will provide details on IoTs and their applications in daily life. As seen in futuristic movies, smart homes have always been the center of attention due to their sleek and high-tech appearance. From motion sensors to voice-enabled speakers to refrigerators with built-in monitors, devices are interconnected, creating the IoT network.
