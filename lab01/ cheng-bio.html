<body>My name is SY Cheng. My current major is Information Management and Technology, and I am interested in anything related to the Internet of Things. I have experience in Robotics, Java, and Python coding. Born and raised in Hong Kong, I am fluent in three languages, including Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. Outside of school, I love discovering niche music and watching TV Shows. During my time in High School, I seized the opportunity to go on study-abroad trips. One of them was an art program, where we did plein aire drawing while travelling throughout Europe. These two terms of studying abroad sparked my goal to travel the world. My favourite sports are skiing and whitewater kayaking. </body>
